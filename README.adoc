=== Build Graal Native Image

This was tested by building normal build with JDK 8 and 11 and then using Graal 19.1.1 to build the native image.


[source,bash]
----
# Install GraalVM native-image compiler
gu install native-image
# Create the native image
./gradlew nativeImage 
----

_I prefer using link:https://sdkman.io/[sdkman] to switch runtimes while doing this kind of exercise._
